## General Information
The aim is to build a CNN model to accurately determine the class of the disease.
The data set contains the following diseases:

    Actinic keratosis
    Basal cell carcinoma
    Dermatofibroma
    Melanoma
    Nevus
    Pigmented benign keratosis
    Seborrheic keratosis
    Squamous cell carcinoma
    Vascular lesion

There are a total of 2357 images among these folders.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
Initially, the model used was underfitting. Later with augmentation underfitting was removed.
By balancing the classes with 500 samples each, the accuracy of the model increased greatly from around 47% to 92%.


## Technologies Used
TensorFlow and Keras librbaries
Augmentor library
